A powerful (responsive) WordPress® theme; built on Bootstrap.

== Description ==

s2Clean is an extremely flexible theme built for WordPress. It also utilizes the popular [Bootstrap CSS/JavaScript frameworks](http://getbootstrap.com/) designed by Twitter (a fully Responsive mobile-first design architecture). s2Clean transforms all of WordPress into a Bootstrap-compatible CMS, including support for all WordPress components; such as custom Post Types, Post Type Archives, custom Taxonomies, Post Formats, Menus, Widgets, Pages, Posts, the `<!--more-->` tag, custom Excerpts, Custom Fields, search results and more.

= Optionally Supports Markdown and Embedly® =

s2Clean also supports [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) (highly recommended) and [Embedly®](http://embed.ly/). s2Clean can be configured (optionally) to disable all native WordPress content filters and replace these with a more powerful alternative which supports all existing WordPress content publishing tools (such as Shortcodes and other plugins that filter `the_content`); PLUS you will gain the ability to publish content in Markdown; along with 50+ oEmbed providers aggregated by Embedly®. Raw HTML is also perefectly acceptable in the mix; and is escpecially helpful when publishing more than just text and images; e.g. when you want to take full advantage of Bootstrap CSS classes on some Posts/Pages. Things like menus, tabs, lists, panels, and much more. Simply follow the extensive documentation here: <http://getbootstrap.com/components/>; and the advice presented by s2Clean in your Dashboard.

= A Lean, Mean, Publishing Machine! =

s2Clean has a very light footprint. You want SPEED!, right? s2Clean has been engineered with namespaced [OOP design patterns in PHP](http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.php). These are FAST! (requires PHP v5.3+). s2Clean is also quite extensible through WordPress hooks/filters integrated into the s2Clean source code. This WordPress theme could even be used as a parent theme framework for [WordPress Child Themes](http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes); making it possible for developers to achieve an even higher level of customization when necessary.

In addition to it's PHP code, s2Clean also optimizes all of it's own CSS and JavaScript files through minification; and by [lazy loading](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_loading) components automatically (without any site owner configuration being necessary; it's possible, but not necessary). s2Clean's ability to lazy load CSS/JS libraries based on the content and components you choose for a given Post/Page will dramatically reduce the time it takes a first-time visitor to render your site.

= Powerful Theme Options Offer Great Flexibility =

s2Clean comes with a powerful (yet, easy-to-use) Theme Options panel in the WordPress Dashboard. Giving you full control over its operation and functionality. In addition to WP basics and core components offered by s2Clean, it's also possible to configure things like: a Footbar, a peek-a-boo Sidebar, custom code of your own in various pre-configured locations within the layout, [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/), web fonts (like [Google Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts)), a favicon, a custom background color/image, a Bootstrap theme, SEO enhancements, a theme for code syntax highlighting (powered by [Highlight.js](http://highlightjs.org/)), error pages, a contact form; and even a [Content Security Policy](http://developer.chrome.com/apps/contentSecurityPolicy.html) if you like.

= Bonus Features offered by the s2Clean Theme =

**fancyBox —** The s2Clean theme is also pre-integrated with a licensed copy of [fancyBox](http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/#examples). fancyBox is a tool that offers an elegant way to add zooming functionality for single images, entire image galleries, html content; and even audio/video. If you enable fancyBox, any `[gallery]` shortcodes that you post in WordPress will take advantage of fancyBox automatically. fancyBox is also enabled automatically for single attachments. You can learn more about fancyBox from your s2Clean Options panel in WordPress.

**s2Member —** s2Clean is maintained by WebSharks™; the developers behind the wildly popular [s2Member®](http://www.s2member.com/) plugin for WordPress (created by Lead Developer Jason Caldwell). While s2Clean works well for ANY type of site, it's an extremely popular choice for membership sites that run the s2Member plugin. As you might imagine, it has been well tested against s2Member and works great with s2Member Pro Forms too. It's a great theme to use when building a site that will offer premium services to paying members of your site. Among other things, it offers Conditional Logic for menu items in WordPress, a built-in modal Login Box, and offers the option to control no-cache headers on the site (a great feature).

**Quick Cache —** The s2Clean lead developer (Jason Caldwell) also designed the popular [Quick Cache](http://www.websharks-inc.com/product/quick-cache/) plugin for WordPress. For this reason it is highly recommended that you also install the free Quick Cache plugin (or Quick Cache Pro) together with s2Clean for even greater speeds! s2Clean and Quick Cache are maintained by the same developers; perfecto!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is there a live DEMO for the s2Clean Theme? =

Yes, please see: <http://www.websharks-inc.com/product-demos/s2clean/>

= Bootstrap or Shortcodes? =

Bootstrap! While many themes offer dozens of WordPress Shortcodes for components like tabs, list items, etc; s2Clean does not. It doesn't need to. s2Clean is built on Bootstrap; which already provides this functionality and more :-) Bootstrap is also mobile-friendly! Simply follow the documentation here: <http://getbootstrap.com/components/>. You can use any of the Bootstrap CSS utility classes (very powerful). s2Clean also comes pre-integrated with the full JavaScript library provided by Bootstrap.

= What Shortcodes does s2Clean offer? =

Please see the previous question "Bootstrap or Shortcodes?". That being said, s2Clean DOES come with a few Shortcodes, but only for things that are truly useful AND perhaps not possible with Bootstrap CSS alone. Please review the live demo of s2Clean for Shortcode examples.

= Does s2Clean Offer any SEO Tools? =

Yes. SEO is very important and there are tools that come with the s2Clean clean which give you to lots of control and flexibility when it comes to SEO. The s2Clean tools for SEO can be enabled (or not). Some site owners have plugins they've already grown to depend on for SEO. You can use s2Clean's existing toolset for SEO (recommended), or choose one of your own (perhaps from WordPress.org). We leave the choice to you :-)

= Is there a Free Version of the s2Clean Theme? =

No, s2Clean is a premium WordPress theme. However, there is a [live demo](http://www.websharks-inc.com/product-demos/s2clean/).

= Does s2Clean come with Source Code? =

Yes. The majority of s2Clean is GPL; meaning, you are free to modify and adapt this theme to meet your needs. That being said, we generally discourage modifying any of the core s2Clean files directly; this can make updating to the latest version of s2Clean much harder (e.g. you would need to apply your modifications again after each update; this can be difficult). Instead, s2Clean provides many WordPress hooks/filters integrated into it's source code. This way developers can introduce their own custom code (or modify existing s2Clean code) from files of their own; which live outside the s2Clean namespace.

**Tip:** most site owners find s2Clean's "Custom Code" section in the Dashboard meets their needs completely, and none of this is necessary. No hooks/filters, no modifying source files. Just use the "Custom Code" section in your Dashboard when you need more advanced customization. This is the simplest way to achieve greater control over s2Clean.

== Pro Features ==

= s2Clean is a premium WordPress theme (e.g. there is no free version available). Therefore, all features provided by the s2Clean theme are considered "Pro Features". Below is a list of the current features provided by the s2Clean theme for WordPress®. =

* **Deactivation Safeguards —** It's possible to control what happens when/if the s2Clean theme is deactivated from the WordPress Dashboard. By default, Deactivation Safeguards are enabled. This preserves all of your configuration settings should you deactivate this theme inadvertenly.
* **Custom Fields**; for granular control at the Post/Page level. From your Post/Page editing station in WordPress, please check the meta box titled "Custom Fields Supported by Theme". There you will find further details and documentation on several Custom Fields that allow for granular control at the Post/Page level.
* **No-Cache Headers —** This does NOT prevent you from using plugins like Quick Cache or W3 Total Cache. It also does NOT impact things like images, JavaScript or CSS files. It simply reduces confusion on sites that have members logging in and out. If a user logs in, you want to be sure they aren'nt still seeing the cached version of a page they visited before they logged-in; and vice-versa. See also: [nocache_headers](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/nocache_headers).
* **Automatic Feed Links (or a Custom Feed Link) —** Unless you're running plugins that seriously alter WordPress XML/RSS feeds, it is best to use Automatic Feed Links. See this document in the WordPress Codex: [Automatic Feed Links](http://codex.wordpress.org/Automatic_Feed_Links). This theme also supports an optional custom feed link (for your primary feed). For instance, you may want to use FeedBurner to power your primary feed and make it available for everyone to subscribe to. FeedBurner is sometimes preferred for serving the primary feed as it has detailed statistics and display options such as sharing buttons. See: [FeedBurner™](http://feedburner.com/).
* **JavaScript in Footer —** This theme gives you the option of loading all JavaScript dependencies in the footer for improved page speed. The default (and recommended value) is "yes, load JavaScript dependencies in the footer".
* **Custom Favicon.** You can choose to use the default favicon image, or a custom favicon that matches the logo for your site.
* **Custom Code —** s2Clean supports custom code (including support for PHP tag evaluation) in four important locations globally, and at the Post/Page level for granular control. The locations for custom code include: `wp_head` (before the closing `</head>` tag), `header_elements` (before the content body), `footer_elements` (after the content body), and `wp_footer` (before the closing `</body>` tag). This theme also incorporates many theme-specific hooks/filters for developers who wish to do something more creative.
* **SEO Tools —** You can choose to use s2Clean's SEO Tools (recommended); or disable them and use another plugin if you prefer. s2Clean's SEO Tools enable automatic meta tags for robots, keywords, and a description; making your site easier for search engines to index (and to help you avoid duplicate content warnings from search engine spiders). It also gives you the ability to customize things further; globally and at the Post/Page level for granular control.
* **OpenGraph —** s2Clean can be configured to implement OpenGraph meta tags on every page of your site (recommended). This is how Facebook, Google+ and countless other services find an image thumbnail and details for content that you publish. You want these networks to have something to display for each Post/Page when your content is shared and/or cross-referenced on networks such as these.
* **Bootstrap Theme —** This theme is built on top of the Bootstrap CSS framework (mobile friendly); and it uses the default Bootstrap theme (recommended). However, if you have another Bootstrap theme you prefer to use, you can specify the URL for it. See also: [BootSwatch.com](http://bootswatch.com/). Any theme you find at BootSwatch.com can be loaded via the BootStrap CDN. See: [BootStrap CDN (BootSwatch)](http://www.bootstrapcdn.com/#bootswatch_tab).
* **Custom Background CSS.** s2Clean exposes the CSS that defines a background color, image, repetition, position, etc. You may customize this to match the look n' feel you desire. Using a custom background together with a custom Bootstrap theme, and adding custom web fonts (from Google Fonts) into the mix; makes it VERY easy to completely change the look n' feel of s2Clean's default appearance; and this makes s2Clean a great product to use when your intention is to run the same theme across multiple sites that you operate.
* **Web Fonts —** s2Clean makes it possible for you to pull in web fonts (such as [Google Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts)); and then specify CSS selectors that match specific elements on the site which should use those web fonts. Very easy to work with, and this can really enhance the presentation of typograhy that's used on our site.
* **Fixed Top Navigation Bar —** The Navbar runs across the top of the site in a fixed position; e.g. it remains in the same place as you scroll the page. With s2Clean you can build custom menus with WordPress and add them to your Navbar. This theme also activates some new options when building WordPress menus, making it possible for you to create things like menu dividers; you can also add 2D icons provided by Font Awesome.
* **Navbar Conditional Logic —** If you're looking for a way to display menu items only for certain types of users; or only when some other conditions apply; s2Cleans comes to the rescue with Conditional Logic being made available for any custom menu item you create with WordPress.
* **Navbar Style/Components.** Bootstrap is known for offering two different Navbar flavors implemented in the core Bootstrap CSS framework (`default` or `inverse`). s2Clean makes this configurable from your theme options panel, along with some additional components that can be enabled; such as a branded logo, search box, and a configurable login/registration modal popup box.
* **SSL Compatible —** s2Clean is built from the ground up with SSL compatibility in mind. If you intend to run plugins like s2Member where Pro Forms need to run over the `https` protocol, s2Clean won't get in your way; and in fact it offers many features which are designed to accomodate a site that might offer membership to it's users. s2Clean is also compatible with the WordPress core configuration options `FORCE_SSL_LOGIN` and/or `FORCE_SSL_ADMIN`.
* **Markdown Publishing —** Optional, but highly recommended for advanced users. This allows you to publish content in the [Markdown syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) (actually — [Markdown Extra](http://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/), to be more specific); or with pure HTML — because Markdown allows for pure HTML to be incorporated also. Markdown processing is also 100% compatible with WordPress Shortcodes, and even with plugins like [ezPHP](http://www.websharks-inc.com/product/ezphp/).
* **Auto-Generated Excerpts —** When you publish a Post/Page and you don't supply a custom Excerpt; and you don't use the [`<!--more-->`](http://codex.wordpress.org/Customizing_the_Read_More) tag either, a default Excerpt will be generated automatically by clipping a text version of the full content. s2Clean can also be configured to clip a specific number of characters in this scenario. It is also possible to customize the "Continue Reading" text that's displayed in archive views and/or in search result listings.
* **Peek-a-Boo Floating Sidebar —** The Sidebar in this theme is dynamic (it allows for widget configurations). A floating peek-a-boo Sidebar is displayed if, and only if, you've added widgets to it. To customize your Sidebar (optional), you can simply use the widget tools that come with WordPress or with any custom widgets that you install from 3rd parties. In this theme the Sidebar floats in a fixed position on the right side; e.g. it remains in the same location as you scroll the page. In addition, the Sidebar in this theme (if you choose to enable it by adding widgets); plays peek-a-boo with your visitors. In order to open the Sidebar a visitor must toggle it open by clicking the tab on the right side of the screen.
* **Floating Sharebar (Social Networking) —** This improves usability and increases exposure on social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter and Google+. The Sharebar floats on the left side of your site in a fixed position; e.g. it remains in the same location as you scroll the page. The Sharebar makes it easy for visitors to share the current page they are viewing on your site with their friends or associates via social networking sites. It's also possible to configure the services that will be featured here; and a special option is made available that opens a list of dozens of other social networking services for those who prefer to share in another way. This works together with the AddThis® service; so it's also possible to gain insight via statistics provided by AddThis®.
* **Contact Form Shortcode —** s2Clean comes with a Bootstrap-enhanced `[contact_form /]` shortcode that can be integrated into various areas of your site and configured in each case to send email to a differernt dept. (e.g. to a different list of recipients); and/or with a different subject line.
* **TabOverride.** Optional. This enables the tab key (for indentation of code samples and other text) in various areas of your theme where user input is accepted in a `<textarea>` form field. For instance, the comment message field will allow a tab key if you enable this (i.e. an actual TAB inside the field). You can also enable this yourself in any `<textarea>` form fields that you create in a Post/Page. Just add the following HTML data attribute to enable tabs: `<textarea data-toggle="taboverride"></textarea>`.
* **Highlight.js Syntax Highlighting —** Optional. This enables automatic syntax highlighting for any code samples that you publish (or that comments may include). This is applied to all instances of `<pre><code>...</code></pre>` tags. While not required, you can be specific about the language of the code. Example: `<pre><code class="language-php">`. Or, if you're using Markdown syntax you can achieve this using fenced code blocks in either Markdown `~~~` and/or GFM-style backticks. If you have `<pre><code>` tags that you would prefer to exclude from syntax highlighting, you can add the `no-highlight` class. Example: `<pre><code class="no-highlight">`.
* **Embedly® —** Optional. This enables automatic content embeds for popular online services such as YouTube, Vimeo, CodePen, jsFiddle, and countless others. With Embedly enabled, simply place a URL on it's own line (all by itself) and watch the magic happen. It's never been easier to post YouTube videos, code samples, or pull a summary from a website automatically by simply posting a URL on it's own line.
* **fancyBox —** Optional. This is a nifty tool that offers an elegant way to add zooming functionality for single images, entire image galleries, html content; and even audio/video. If you enable fancyBox, any `[gallery]` shortcodes that you post in WordPress will take advantage of fancyBox automatically. fancyBox is also enabled automatically for single attachments. In your theme options there is further documentation that shows how to easily use fancyBox in other custom components; or you can follow the [fancyBox documentation here](http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/).
* **Comment Options —** Comments are a key component in any successful blog. In addition to the options which WordPress itself provides (and s2Clean is fully compatible with); s2Clean can also enable Markdown and Embedly for commenters too, making it easier for them to engage with you and other comment authors. It's also possible to customize the size of avatars in the list of comments, and to choose whether you want to display trackbacks/pingbacks in the list of comments; or not.
* **Dynamic Footbar —** The Footbar is dynamic (it allows widgets). The Footbar is displayed at the bottom of your site; if, and only if, you've added widgets to it. To customize your Footbar (optional), you can simply use the widget tools that come with WordPress or with any custom widgets that you install from 3rd parties. The widgets that you configure (if you want to display the Footbar at all); must conform to one of three layout models. You can choose the one you prefer from your theme options panel in WordPress.
* **Error Pages —** s2Clean comes with three customizable errors pages. These deal with 404 Page Not Found errors, 204 Content Not Found; and a special error page that can be displayed when/if a user comes up completely empty when performing a search on your site. By default, s2Clean implements some humurous images on these error pages, but you may choose to replace these with anything you like better.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP) —** For sites that would like to take security to the next level. A Content Security Policy (CSP) is an optional added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks. s2Clean has been built from the ground up with a CSP in mind; and it offers MANY configurable options that will help you implement a good CSP for your site.
* **Import/Export —** s2Clean offers MANY configurable options. If you intend to run the s2Clean theme on more than one site, having the ability to export your s2Clean configuration from a site you've already setup, and import those configuration options into a new site; can REALLY save time. This is an extremely useful feature for developers also.
* **s2Member —** s2Clean is maintained by WebSharks™; the developers behind the wildly popular [s2Member®](http://www.websharks-inc.com/product/s2member/) plugin for WordPress (created by Lead Developer Jason Caldwell). While s2Clean works well for ANY type of site, it's an extremely popular choice for membership sites that run the s2Member plugin. As you might imagine, it has been well tested against s2Member and works great with s2Member Pro Forms too. It's a great theme to use when building a site that will offer premium services to paying members of your site. Among other things, it offers Conditional Logic for menu items in WordPress, a built-in modal Login Box, and offers the option to control no-cache headers on the site (a great feature).
* **Quick Cache —** The s2Clean lead developer (Jason Caldwell) also designed the popular [Quick Cache](http://www.websharks-inc.com/product/quick-cache/) plugin for WordPress. For this reason it is highly recommended that you also install the free Quick Cache plugin (or Quick Cache Pro) together with s2Clean for even greater speeds! s2Clean and Quick Cache are maintained by the same developers; perfecto!
* **Bootstrap Utility Classes —** While many themes offer dozens of WordPress Shortcodes for components like tabs, list items, etc; s2Clean does not. It doesn't need to. s2Clean is built on Bootstrap; which already provides this functionality and more :-) Bootstrap is also mobile-friendly! Simply follow the documentation here: <http://getbootstrap.com/components/>. You can use any of the Bootstrap CSS utility classes (very powerful). s2Clean also comes pre-integrated with the full JavaScript library provided by Bootstrap.
* **Shortcodes —** *Please see the previous feature "Bootstrap Utility Classes".* In addition to all of the Bootstrap utility classes, s2Clean DOES come with a few Shortcodes, but only for things that are truly useful AND perhaps not possible with Bootstrap CSS alone. Please review the [live demo](http://www.websharks-inc.com/product-demos/s2clean/) of s2Clean for shortcode examples. Some of these shortcodes include: `[raw][/raw]` for adding pure HTML (not necessary if you enable Markdown processing with s2Clean, but `[raw][/raw]` can still be helpful in some rare cases); there is also a `[tag_cloud /]` shortcode, a `[contact_form /]`, and `[wp_readme_tabs /]`. Examples of all of these (and more) and provided in the [live demo](http://www.websharks-inc.com/product-demos/s2clean/).
